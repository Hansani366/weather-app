 WeatherCast - Your Personalized Weather Companion ☀️🌧️

I’m excited to share my latest project, WeatherCast, a sleek and interactive weather forecasting web app designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Powered by the OpenWeatherMap API, this app allows users to:

🌍 Search for any city and get real-time weather updates.

📊 View detailed weather data, including temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, and more.

🌟 Quickly access weather information for popular cities like New York, London, and Tokyo with one click.

🎨 Features a modern UI with intuitive design for a seamless user experience.


This project has been a great learning experience in web development, UI/UX design, and API integration. I’m proud of how it turned out and look forward to expanding its features further!
